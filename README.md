# SingularityFinance Script

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The testnet wrapped up on **April 4th**. This tool is no longer necessary for interacting with the testnet.

## Overview
SingularityFinance Script (SFIS) is designed for interacting with testnets in order to participate in airdrop events. This script automates essential tasks like token wrapping, unwrapping, staking, unstaking, and bridging, allowing you to efficiently manage your testnet assets and increase your chances of qualifying for airdrops. By running the script, you can perform routine actions required by various projects on supported testnets, and potentially earn rewards in the form of airdrops.

### 4.Run the Script
Once the configuration is set up, you can run the script with your private key or a private key file:
- **Using your private key directly:**
```bash
python3 sfis.py -pk <your-private-key>
```

- **Using a private key file:**
```bash
python3 sfis.py -f <path-to-private-key-file>
```
## Important Notes
- **Daily Tasks**: The script will perform daily operations, such as (un)staking, (un)wrapping, swapping and bridging tokens.
- **Bridging Task**: ~~The bridging task requires waiting for Layer 1 (L1) confirmation. After running the script for the first time, please allow for a 1-hour wait before re-running the script with the `-P` and `-F` flags to prove and finalize the bridging process.~~ Disabled.
```bash
python3 sfis.py ... -P
```
```bash
python3 sfis.py ... -F
```
